# learning-python

Setup a new GitHub repo with a README file that has instruction for installing the new language tools & resources your group found useful. Then add some notes with an example of each of the items listed above. Think of this Readme as a way to highlight your new language learning journey. This is a great way to show potential employers that you can tackle a challenge and learn a new language quickly!
